- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?

It is a very basic PokemonGo-inspired game where the player gets to move around, capture Pokemons, and collect skin items. 

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?

None

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Most of the code worked although there may be some errors.
